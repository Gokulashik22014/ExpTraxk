3. **Setting Up the Server**

    For the backend, we use Express and Node.js, and for the database, we use MongoDB. Follow these steps to set up the server:

    a. Create a MongoDB account, set up a cluster, and create a collection.

    b. Get the URI of your MongoDB cluster and add it to a `.env` file in the server directory with the name `MONGO_URI`. Also, specify your port number in the `.env` file with the name `PORT`.

        Example `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   PORT=3000
   ```

Thanks for taking the time to visit this repo.The code is working fine but however at the start of the application it is bit buggy. The Dougnut chart is updating but updates wrongly the first time but when page is refreshed the chart is back to normal and the overall website is slow ðŸ˜… if you have any suggestions to improve it please let me know.  Happy Coding!
